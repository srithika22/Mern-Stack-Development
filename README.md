# MERN Stack Development: My Learnings, Tasks, Projects

Welcome to my MERN Stack Development journey!  
This repository is my open notebook, showcasing all the tasks, homework, and projects I complete as I learn and build with the MERN stack and modern web technologies.  
I update this README regularly to reflect new skills, accomplishments, and resources.
